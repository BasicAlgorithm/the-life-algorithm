# The Life Algorithm

The source code of artificial general intelligence.

The different three levels at which AGI device must be understood before one can be said to have understood it completely. Table [1](#table-1-levels-of-agi) is an initial approach [[1]](#1).

## Table 1: Levels of AGI

| Level | Concept | Human | AGI
| -|-|-|-
| First | Theory | Psychophysics | What/Why
| Second | Algorithm | Psychophysics | How
| Third | Physical device | Neuroanatomy | Device
